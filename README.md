# MultipleLinearRegressionModel_R

A guideline on how to create a Mutliple Linear Regression Model in R, interpret the results and draw conclusions.

The Problem:

An efficiency report claims that productivity in a closed office envirnoment is directly affected by temperature and relative humidity.											
A random sample of office workers was obtained with words per minute. Data also has temperature in Farenheit and relative humidity as percentage.											
											
Words Per Minute	(52	56	69	58	61	65	51	63	63	67)

Temperature		(74	77	69	73	72	71	76	73	74	72)

Relative Humidity	(51	45	42	45	45	47	41	48	44	45)	
											
Find the estimated regression equation in R.
